# Computer-Vision
Currently, I am going through the course on [Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://g.co/kgs/fnRCrP).  
This repository contains my programming work for this course, as well as my attempt to recreate some of the amazing visualizations and demonstrations from the class.
For most of the programs, there is a notebook (.ipynb) file and a python (.py) file. The notebook is where I have developed the program step by step along with regular output checks and explanations. After I get the working model ready I have modularised and put the code in a python file with the same name.
