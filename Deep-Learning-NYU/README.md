# Deep Learning NYU
This repository contains my programming work for the [Deep Learning in PyTorch](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) class by NYU.
This is probably the most up to date course available right now. I am thankful to [Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/ylecun) and [Alfredo Canziani](https://twitter.com/alfcnz) for making it freely available. Guys, seriously you should follow [alf on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alfcnz), and I am not kidding (an inside joke from the class ;)
