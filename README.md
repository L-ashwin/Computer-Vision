# Computer-Vision
Currently, I am going through the course on [Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://g.co/kgs/fnRCrP).  
This repository contains my programming work for this course, as well as my attempt to recreate some of the amazing visualizations and demonstrations from the class.
